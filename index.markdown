## About Me

My name is Dr. Daniel Hayden and I am a Native American plant pathologist. I am enrolled Comanche and also descendent of Pawnee and Muscogee people.
I like to spend time with my wife Amber and our cat Pui. We all enjoy hanging around the apartment, going to eat at cool places in Chicago, and watching movies.
I also enjoy reading a lot of non-fiction, playing Civilization V, and cooking new recipes for Amber. 


## Research Interests

- Indigenous agriculture
	- Our current understanding of Indigenous agriculture (IA) is underwhelming. Most of our understanding presented by Western scholars is based in the past. 
	Historical records describe what explorers and colonizers saw and archeology finds evidence for areas where Indigneous peoples grew crops. This falls into the classic 
	perspctive of Indigneous peoples and ideas being antiquated and this further pushes us to beleive what we know can inform us today. This is blatantly not true and ignorant to the 
	complexity of Indigneous agriculture, in both the management practices and the ecology that supports cropping systems. Furthermore, Indigenous peoples are still here and continuing
	their traditional way of farming crops and stewarding the land. My interest is better understanding Indigenous agriculture from an ecological perspective, where practices and ideas
	can be tested, adapted, and understoof in collaboration with Indigenous peoples. We can then share knowledge with the broader scientific community that is seeking to make farming
	more sustainible and efficient.  If we are serious about diversifying our cropping systems, reducing tillage, improving ecosystem services then we must listen to the people who farmed these lands 
	for centuries.
- Cover Crops
	- The agricultural landscape is dominated by high-yielding crops grown in monoculture. A dominant paradigm within Western agriculture is tillage, working up soils to prepare for planting. 
	Since the Green Revolution in the 1960s, tillage has supplemented industrial agriculture alongside chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. By relying on tillage and these intensive agricultural
	practices, soil health has rapidly reduced as erosion from tillage has led to loss of carbon and organic matters in soil. To address these issues, soil must be covered by plants where roots hold soil structure, add organic matter
	, and stimulate belowground micorbial activity. Cover crops perform these tasks as non-harvested plants that can be seeded by farmers, often in between growing seasons where soil usually lays
	bare and most susceptible to erosion. Cover crops can be many different species of plants that can perform certain jobs also. Legumes add nitrogen, brassica can breach hard soils through their tap roots, and grasses 
	improve soil structure. There are still many questions regarding how to essentially sell cover crops as an idea to the broader agricultural community. This involves understanding the best practices,
	 what species work well in what contexts, and how many species can you use to improve biodiversity. My interest is bringing cover crops to smaller and community-led agroecosystems such as urban agricultre and tribal growers.
- Plant-Microbe Interactions
	- Plants are not islands, but interact broadly with other plants, insects, animals, and microbes above and belowground. Much has been elucidated about how microbes influence plants.
	We know microbes can control both the density and diversity of plant commuities. We also know that plants have co-evolved with both good an bad microbes and there are many genetic mechanisms within plants that control 
	these relationships. Agriculture is still catching up to these ideas as practices tend to alter these relatinships rather than harness their potenital. For example, crop monocultures favor pathogens of that crop through little diversity and not competition while 
	pesticides have bred for more resistant pathogens. Tillage can inhibit the fungal networks that supply nutrients to crops and fertilizer inputs reduced the need for crops to rely on microbes for nutrient acquisition. I argue and much of my research advocates for 
	diversifying cropping systems to act analogous to plant communities like praries, where a diverse amount of plants rely on microbes for nutrient cycling, while the diversity inhibits pathogens from gaining a foothold. This is known as intercropping
	or polyculture and I am interested in how microbes in these intercropping systems influence crops.
